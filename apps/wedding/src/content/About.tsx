        Steven and Ariana met in Williamsburg, VA at the Brick House Tavern—the
        only place you can dance in Williamsburg. Steven was working in
        Williamsburg as a web developer and Ariana was visiting for William &
        Mary’s Homecoming. Ariana was dancing with friends when Steven
        approached her to say, “Hi, I’m Steven.” He looked just like Obama, so
        Ariana was smitten, and they danced into the night. The two exchanged
        information and, the next day, Steven asked Ariana to have dinner (their
        first date). Being together felt like home, although they were
        practically strangers. Ariana had to leave Williamsburg (as she was only
        visiting), but Steven and Ariana continued conversing over the next
        several months.
